# Live Voice for Hermes Desktop 🎙️

Native **full-duplex voice** for [Hermes](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) — talk to your
bots from Hermes Desktop with real-time audio, live transcript, voice tool calls and task delegation.

**Engine:** [GPT-Live-1](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-live-1-in-the-api/) (`gpt-live-1-codex`)
through the local **Codex app-server**, running on a **ChatGPT/Codex subscription** — no API key needed
for the voice lane.

## Features

- 🎧 **Full-duplex, interruptible voice** over WebRTC — audio goes device ↔ model directly (the server only brokers the session).
- 🤖 **Persona-aware** — the voice session adopts the active bot's `SOUL.md` identity.
- 🗣️ **English or Danish** — the voice answers in English or Danish only (Danish by default on a Danish desktop locale); see [`docs/model-context-language.md`](docs/model-context-language.md).
- 📝 **Live transcript** — iMessage-style bubbles (you / bot), streaming deltas, tool activity chips.
- 🛠️ **Tools from voice** — the model can run tasks: by default they are delegated into your **focused Hermes chat**, i.e. your own agent with **your** models and providers. A voice-side delegation policy keeps this clean (only real task requests are delegated, fillers stay conversational) and an internal queue prevents overlapping runs. Tasks never run on the backend's Codex thread: the broker blocks that lane (see *Call isolation and task execution*).
- 🎚️ **Audio & call controls** — device pickers, built-in mic test, one-tap **mute** and hang-up right in the composer.
- 📊 **Usage panels** — measured voice minutes (rolling windows) and the Codex plan bucket.

## Requirements

- **Hermes Agent** (backend) and **Hermes Desktop** (app).
- **`codex` CLI ≥ 0.160** (validated: **0.160.0**), logged in with a ChatGPT plan (`codex login` — device auth). Older
  app-servers are refused because they cannot confirm the voice thread's execution restrictions.
- Python 3.11+ for the backend half.

## Install

The plugin ships as a **unified package**: a backend half (`dashboard/plugin_api.py`, mounted by the
Hermes dashboard under `/api/plugins/talk-desktop/`) and a desktop half (`desktop/plugin.js`, loaded by
the Hermes Desktop app).

### From the Hermes plugin catalog

```bash
hermes plugins install hermes-live-voice   # curated catalog · tier: community
hermes plugins enable talk-desktop
```

The catalog entry pins a released revision of this repo (updates: `hermes plugins update
hermes-live-voice`). It lands in `$HERMES_HOME/plugins/talk-desktop` — the folder name the desktop
app expects — so the desktop half is picked up on the next app start.

### Same-machine setup (manual)

```bash
# 1) Drop the repo into your Hermes plugins directory:
cp -r hermes-live-voice "$HERMES_HOME/plugins/talk-desktop"     # default: ~/.hermes/plugins/talk-desktop

# 2) Enable the backend plugin (config.yaml → plugins.enabled) and restart the dashboard.
```

The desktop app discovers the desktop half from the plugin folder
(`$HERMES_HOME/plugins/talk-desktop/desktop/plugin.js`) automatically.

### Remote desktop (app on another machine, backend on a server)

1. Install the backend half on the server as above.
2. Copy **only** `desktop/plugin.js` to the desktop machine:
   `$HERMES_HOME/desktop-plugins/talk-desktop/plugin.js` — the folder name must equal the plugin id
   (`talk-desktop`), and `plugin.js` must sit at the folder root.
3. In the app: `Ctrl/Cmd+K` → **“Reload desktop plugins”**.

## First run

1. The mic button appears in the composer (next to the `+` row). Click to start a call.
2. Open the gear ⚙ for settings: **Bot → Voice engine → Voice → Audio**.
3. If this is a fresh machine: sign in to Codex first (`codex login`) or use the in-panel session flow.

## Configuration

`settings.json` is stored next to the installed backend plugin
(`$HERMES_HOME/plugins/talk-desktop/settings.json`). See `settings.example.json`:

| key | values | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `codexAgentModel` | a ChatGPT-valid Codex model slug (e.g. `gpt-5.6-sol`) | *(unset)* | Model for each call's backing Codex thread. Needed only when the machine's default Codex model is not ChatGPT-valid (e.g. a custom provider proxy) and `thread/start` fails. |
| `delegation` | `client` | `client` | Voice-delegated tasks run in your focused Hermes chat. `server` (tasks in a Codex agent thread) was removed in 0.3.0; a call configured for it fails with `LIVE_UNSUPPORTED` instead of switching execution lanes. |

The backend also reads `TALK_CODEX_BINARY` (an absolute path to the `codex` executable to use) and
`TALK_CODEX_AGENT_MODEL` (overrides `codexAgentModel`) from its environment.

## Troubleshooting

First-run gotchas:

- **No sign-in prompt?** The voice session needs a ChatGPT-plan Codex login. Open the mic
  config (gear while the plugin is visible) → the auth card shows your sign-in state and a
  **Sign in** button: it opens `auth.openai.com/codex/device` with a code to type.
  Nothing to copy by hand from a terminal.
- **`codex` not found in the dashboard logs?** The backend resolves `codex` from
  `~/.local/bin`, `$PATH` and `/usr/local/bin`. If your service runs with a minimal
  `PATH`, add the codex bin directory to the service environment.
- **"Method Not Allowed" (or "Not Found") when starting a voice session?** The backend half
  is not mounted in the dashboard, so the request falls through to its catch-all page. The
  dashboard mounts plugin routes **only at startup**: restart the dashboard (or the service
  running it) after installing or enabling `talk-desktop`, and make sure it is listed under
  `plugins.enabled` in `config.yaml`. Then look for `Mounted plugin API routes:
  /api/plugins/talk-desktop/` in the Hermes logs; a `Failed to load plugin talk-desktop API
  routes` warning (not an error) gives the real import failure. Remote setups: the dashboard
  on the **server** is the one to restart, not the desktop app.
- **Persona too generic?** The voice reads the focused bot's `SOUL.md`. No bot focused →
  it uses your Hermes default identity.

## How it works

The desktop renderer negotiates a WebRTC session against the ChatGPT backend; a local broker spawns
`codex app-server` and drives the realtime conversation (protocol `v3`, model `gpt-live-1-codex`).
Voice-delegated tasks surface as `delegation` items; the client (by default) routes them to your
focused Hermes chat and feeds the result back to the voice model to speak.

```

### Call isolation and task execution

Several clients (for example a desktop and a phone) can be in calls at the same time. One `codex
app-server` process serves them all, but every call owns a **fresh ephemeral thread**: the SDP answer,
errors, closes, interruptions and stops are routed by that thread's id, so starting, failing,
interrupting or hanging up one call never touches another, and no voice context carries over between
calls. `POST /codexlive/session` returns the call's `threadId`; `/codexlive/stop` and
`/codexlive/interrupt` require it and act only on that live call. A startup that has not produced an
answer within 20 seconds fails and is closed, and an answer for a client that already disconnected is
closed rather than left running.

The realtime core still opens a Codex turn on the call's backing thread for every delegation, even
with client-managed handoffs. The broker does not rely on a prompt to keep that turn idle: the thread
is created with no environment access, a read-only, network-less sandbox and approvals routed to the
broker, which declines all of them; the app-server runs with its tool features (shell, apps, plugins,
browser, web search and so on) disabled; and every backing turn is interrupted as it starts. The
broker logs each backing turn's outcome (`ended interrupted with 0 items`) and warns if one ever runs an
execution item. Calls fail with a coded error instead of degrading:

| error | meaning |
|---|---|
| `LIVE_UNSUPPORTED` | `codex` is older than the validated version, rejected a required field, or `settings.json` asks for server delegation |
| `LIVE_UNSAFE` | the app-server accepted the thread but did not confirm its restrictions |
| `LIVE_TIMEOUT` | no SDP answer within 20 seconds |
| `LIVE_START_FAILED` | the service refused or closed the session |
| `LIVE_SIN_QUOTA` | the ChatGPT plan's voice allowance is used up |

## Status & roadmap

⚠️ **Preview (0.3.x).** The backend resolves its voice plumbing at import time in this order: the
full [`hermes-talk`](https://github.com/TheSmokeDev/hermes-talk) plugin when it is installed (richer
— native voice tools, run steering, cascade modes), otherwise the MIT-licensed fallback bundled in
`dashboard/talk_vendor/`, so a fresh install with no other plugin mounts correctly (covered by a
regression test that runs with an empty `HOME` and no `hermes-talk` present). Runtime dependencies
are the Hermes dashboard's own (`fastapi`, `httpx`); the desktop half has no build step. The complete
Live Voice implementation and the protocol documentation are included here for reference and
integration work.

## Changelog

- **0.3.0** — call-scoped broker. Each Codex Live call gets its own fresh thread, and every app-server response and notification is routed to the call that owns it, so a desktop and a phone can be in calls at once without one stopping, replacing or inheriting the other (previously all calls shared one cached thread, and a failed start could stop a healthy call). Stop and interrupt now require the call's `threadId`. The backing Codex thread can no longer execute delegated work (restricted thread, declined approvals, disabled tool features, every backing turn interrupted); `delegation: server` and the silent fallback when an app-server drops `clientManagedHandoffs` are gone, replaced by coded failures. Requires codex 0.160 or newer. Startup is bounded at 20 seconds. The voice speaks English or Danish only (it used to default to Chilean Spanish), the desktop UI and all model-facing text are English, and broker errors are English.

- **0.2.2** — identity and language polish, on top of community fixes by [@tillstriegel](https://github.com/tillstriegel) ([#4](https://github.com/Synero/hermes-live-voice/pull/4)): the voice identity prompt no longer hardcodes the owner's name, the model-facing voice context follows the session language (es/en), and — fixed here — the delegated-thread recovery path now keeps that language instead of silently recreating the thread in the fallback while the previous run was in the other language. Also: the transcript's user label is localized ("Tú"/"You") rather than a hardcoded name, and the identity docstring no longer lists private bot names. **Why it matters:** the plugin runs on other people's machines, so no installer should ever see someone else's name in the prompt or in the UI.
- **0.2.1** — audit fixes: the backend now imports its **bundled** `talk_vendor` fallback on fresh installs (previously it needed `hermes-talk` installed); a concurrent `/session` pair no longer deadlocks the event loop; app-server RPC correlation survives reader-buffer pruning; `/codexlive/interrupt` runs off the event loop; `CODEX_HOME` is honored consistently across login/backup/logout; when an older app-server drops `clientManagedHandoffs` the response now carries `droppedFields`/`handoffDegraded`/`warning` and the desktop shows a notice instead of failing silently; the desktop interrupt call sends a plain object body (no double-encoding) and a muted mic can no longer be un-muted by barge-in.
- **0.2.0** — call controls (mute button, hover states) + delegation hardening: voice-side delegation policy, TTS-friendly reply note, filler filter, task queue, and neutralized background thread turns (the Codex plan no longer pays for invisible tool work).
- **0.1.0** — initial public preview.

## Tests

```bash
python -m pytest -q
```

Regression tests for the audit findings in issue #1 and the call-scoped broker (no network, no
`codex` binary, no OpenAI calls — pytest, fastapi and httpx). `tests/test_codexlive_broker.py` drives
the real routes against `tests/fake_codex_app_server.py`, a stand-in for `codex app-server` that only
emits per-thread events; it proves the broker's routing, not the subscription service.

`tools/live_call_check.py` is the live counterpart: two WebRTC reference clients make overlapping
**real** calls on the local Codex login (it spends voice allowance) and check delegation, barge-in,
hang-up in both directions and the backing-thread guard, either in-process or through a running
dashboard (`--url`). See the recipe for the recorded runs. CI additionally verifies the bundled fallback imports on a
clean environment (empty `HOME`, no site-packages), compiles the backend, syntax-checks the
desktop half and runs the ESM load harness.

## Credits

Voice auth, session minting and identity plumbing are derived from
[TheSmokeDev/hermes-talk](https://github.com/TheSmokeDev/hermes-talk) (MIT) —
bundled in `dashboard/talk_vendor/` with attribution in `NOTICE.md`. The
plugin prefers the full hermes-talk when it's installed (native voice tools,
run steering, cascade modes); the bundled fallback keeps fresh installs
self-contained.
